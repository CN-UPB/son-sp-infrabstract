<h1>PG-SanDMAN Translator.</h1>

There is also a <a href="../sphinx/html/index.html">Sphinx documentation</a>.
<p>
The Translator constitutes the link between the SONATA descriptor editor and the son-emu datacenter emulator.
</p>
<p>
The editor backend can push SONATA packages, containing SONATA service and function descriptors, to the Translator using the SONATA Gatekeeper REST API.
The Translator processes and stores the service descriptions in a Catalogue.
Using the Webfrontend the service deployment can be triggered.
Control of function placement and connection is managed in the PlacementPlugin component.
The DeploymentManager passes the descriptors to the PlacementPlugin and receives deployment information.
Now the functions can be deployed as HEAT templates on the emulator using the HEAT REST API.
The other OpenStack REST APIs are used to configure the networking.
The Translator requests monitoring information about the deployed functions in regular intervals.
The monitoring information can be used to let the PlacementPlugin check for over- or underload and update the services by adding or removing functions.
Finally the service can be removed from the datacenter emulator.
